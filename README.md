Customized Javascript/CSS Patron Self Registration Form for use with Innovative Millennium

This form was created to suit the needs of the [Oakland Public Library](http://www.oaklandlibrary.org). The sample form distributed by Innovative does not provide much in the way of input validation, and their use of token-replacement to generate html form elements wasn't very customizable. I've put this code up on github in case any other Innovative customers can benefit from my work.

Features:

- Highlighting on empty/unacceptable fields with accompanying help messages
- Display different form fields based on patron age using CSS
- Calculate age based on birth date
- Printer-friendly confirmation page using CSS
- Validation of format for email and phone number fields
- Convert city name to library jurisdiction code
