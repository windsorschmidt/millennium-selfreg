Customized Javascript/CSS Patron Self Registration Forms for use with Innovative Millennium

This form was created to suit the needs of the Oakland Public Library. The sample forms distributed by Innovative do not provide much in the way of validation, and their use of token-replacement to generate html form elements wasn't very customizable. I've put this code up on github in case any other Innovative customers can benefit from my work.
